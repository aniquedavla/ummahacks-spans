A large campus Jummah is held every week. There is a strong sense of brotherhood and sisterhood on campus, fostered by the MSA. There are weekly halaqas both among graduate and undergraduate students and many Muslim friend events and things to do on the Ann Arbor campus. Overall it was a great experience for me and the cohort of students I attended with. ",

One can sit down and make wudu like the masjid(I don't even have that at my house!). The prayer space is small and the school does not have halal food options on campus.",
