I always see hijabies and Muslim looking brothers around. Almost all libraries and buildings have a prayer rooms with rugs. They recently started adding wudu rooms, but still lacking. The MSA is really strong, there are alot of great people and great programing. It was really easy for me to find community and feel included. There is a masjid that is close to the engineering campus, but a bus ride away from the main campus. Alot of Muslims study in one specific library(fishbowl), so if you go there its easy to make friends and meet other Muslims. Most Muslims live in off-campus apartments and not in school dorms, there is a housing list that you can use to find Muslim roommates. There is a sizeable Muslim population that chooses to live in one apartment building (Tower Plaza). The state has other universities that have bigger Muslim populations, but they are usually commuter campuses and hail from Muslim towns, so I believe the University of Michigan makes it easier to build better bonds with other Muslims since we are all living on campus and since we are a (sizeable) minority on campus. All in All, its a great university for Muslims. The main downside I can think of is that we have faaaaaaaar fewer marriages in our MSA compared to other schools, maybe one pair every 3 years. Honestly, not sure why, feels like everyone is focus on career and school. So if you're hoping to find your significant other at college, it might be tough here. Not to discourage you, you never know where Allah has written your rizk. But on a positive note you'll meet and create great bonds with Muslims community here.",

There is a prayer room in the Student Union and there is interfaith building (located in the far end of campus) dedicated to housing all religions, which is equipped with prayer/meditation room and a wudhu station. However, concerns raised over food have been met with counterproductive solutions or ambivalence. Hijabis face a hostile culture and there is little support from the college, and the Muslim organization as far as I know, remains defunct. Hate crimes have been known to take place in the past and there are organizations on campus that threaten the positions of Muslim students in their life on campus.",

I often hear rumors of there being a wudu station in the library but have yet to find it. People yell at hijabis often from cars. Alhamdulillah theyâ€™re trying to be their nicest for Ramadan though. There are 3 churches on campus and no other religious sites for anyone else, but alhamdulillah the masjid is only about a 1/2 mile off campus. You have to be aggressive with ResLife if you only want a Muslim roommate or if you want to move because your roommate is islamaphobic (like I had to), you have to throw a fit. They will try to use you for diversity photos and will assume youâ€™re Arab if you wear the hijab, the guy who teaches the one class about Islam isnâ€™t Muslim. Almost all of the Muslim faculty are in Math and Engineering, they got rid of Arabic despite high interest, and allow very islamaphobic speakers on campus and allow Christian prayers, comments, and rhetoric at university events. However, for the few Muslims there are, theyâ€™re amazing people. Iâ€™ve found my lifelong friends here, the small town feel is nice sometimes. ",
